NomUp leverages Gemini 3's multimodal AI capabilities across three core features to revolutionize grocery management, reducing food waste from forgotten expiration dates and unused ingredients.
Receipt scanning uses Gemini's vision model to analyze grocery receipt photos, automatically extracting item names, quantities, prices, and units. Crucially, Gemini goes further by categorizing each item (produce, dairy, protein), suggesting optimal storage locations (refrigerator, freezer, pantry), and predicting expiration dates—eliminating all manual data entry.
Intelligent recipe matching leverages Gemini's language understanding to match recipe ingredients against your pantry semantically, not just by exact keywords. When a recipe calls for "chicken drumstick" but you have "chicken thigh," Gemini recognizes the substitution. Users see match percentages and exactly what they have versus what they need to buy.
Cooking step enhancement transforms raw recipe instructions into structured, actionable step by step cooking guides. Gemini extracts cooking durations and temperatures from natural language text, enabling interactive Cooking Mode with built-in countdown timers for each step.
Together with visual consumption tracking (10-dot sliders) and proactive expiration alerts, Gemini creates a complete waste-prevention loop—turning the complex task of food management into an effortless, intelligent experience.
